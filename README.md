# Nerdy Valentines Day Card

Welcome Nerds and Happy Valentines Day!  You are probably visiting this page because some awesome person gave you a Nerdy Valentines Card :) 
Use the switch to turn on your Nerdy Valentines Card.  It will display "Happy Valentines Day!" (or a custom message if ordered) and play a song (Minuet in G).  After the song is complete, the display will test your love using the "Love-O-Meter."  Hold down the button until it tells you to stop.  Finally, the display says "I Love You!" (or custom message)  You can also write the name of the special person on the back as well as the date.  A fine tip sharpie marker works best.  

Please review the instructions for inserting the battery.  

SECRET VIDEO GAME IS REVEALED AFTER FINAL SCREEN OR ACTIVATED BY HOLDING DOWN THE BUTTON WHILE POWERING ON!
